# Program-CPP-DinaPuspitaSari_Kalyke_TLS25
Assignment for Galactic Mission TETI Lab Skills

Hi! My name is Dina Puspita Sari from group Kalyke
This repo will consist of 3 C++ programs:

1. Inverse the Sequence!
2. Lost and Found
3. Strange Traffic Lights

The details of the problems are following:
1. Inverted Sequence
Fachriza is doing an Informatics Olympiad question at home. Inside the question
it says that there exists an array consisting of integers with length n. Fachriza
should do a transformation on the array where elements in the even indices will
be reversed by digit (e.g. 1290 to 921), meanwhile elements in odd indices will not
change. What would the logic that Fachriza used be to do transformation and find
the sum of the elements?
Clue: You may use the following array as an example:
[204, 18, -917, 500, 9]
Expected answer: 210

Notice:
Integers in the array may be smaller post-transformation (210
-> 12)
Negative signs should not be erased, whether or not the
transformation effects it or not
If in the array there exists element “0”, the result would still be
“0”, not empty.

2. The Lost Password
A mysterious case happened in New York City! Detective Timothy is looking at the
case when he found a machine that makes unique passwords. The machine works
by removing all vowels, reversing the text, and inserting the ASCII code of the first
character from the original word into the middle of the password.
Timothy tried to use the machine by inserting several words with the results as
shown:
banana -> nn98b
Jakarta -> tr7rkJ
TANGERANG -> GNR84GNT
One day, Timothy found a clue to the case — a paper written “nm71rG”. If the machine
could only work one way, how would Timothy be able to retrieve the original word
based on the password? And what words are possible to be the original word?
Clue: the original word is in English

3. Obey Traffic Lights
Nabila is working for the Department for Transportation in the United Kingdom.
One day, a huge festival is about to take place in Hogwarts, Scotland. To handle the
traffic, Nabila wants to use a special traffic light in an intersection near the festival
grounds that cycles in order:
Green -> Yellow -> Red -> (back to Green)
Due to one thing and another, the light does not start in green, instead it starts in
another color and the cycle continues normally after that.
The duration of green light is 20 seconds, yellow light 3 seconds, and red light 80
seconds. If in the 45th second the light just showed yellow, determine a logic that
could retrieve the color of the traffic light in:

80th second
135th second
150th second
212nd second
After determining the logic, find the color shown by the traffic
light on the given time using your logic!
Clue: The light shows yellow on the 45th to the 47th second
